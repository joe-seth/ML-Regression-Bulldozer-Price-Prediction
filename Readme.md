## Introduction
This README documents the steps taken in a machine learning project for predicting the prices of bulldozers. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the prices of bulldozers. We'll use a dataset containing various features related to bulldozer sales and their prices. The project follows standard machine learning steps, including data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Steps

### 1. Data Visualization
Visualize the sale prices and sale dates to gain insights into the dataset.

### 2. Sorting the DataFrame
Sort the DataFrame by sale date to prepare the data for time-based analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Examine and engineer relevant features that can enhance the model's performance.

### 4. Creating Visualizations
Generate data visualizations to understand the relationships between variables and target.

### 5. Input and Target Columns
Define the input and target columns for the regression task.

### 6. Modeling
Select and train regression models to predict bulldozer prices.

### 7. Converting Objects to Categories
Convert object data types to categories for improved model performance.

### 8. Checking Numeric Features
Ensure that numeric features are correctly identified and handled.

### 9. Filling and Encoding Categorical Variables
Fill missing data and convert categorical variables into numerical form.

### 10. Splitting Data into Train and Validation Sets
Divide the dataset into training and validation sets to assess model performance.

### 11. Building an Evaluation Function
Create an evaluation function to measure the model's performance.

### 12. Testing the Model on a Subset
Test the model on a subset of the data to ensure it's functioning as expected.

### 13. Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
Optimize model hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.

### 14. Training a Model with the Best Hyperparameters
Train the model with the best hyperparameters obtained from the tuning process.

### 15. Making Predictions on Test Data
Generate predictions on the test data to evaluate the model's generalization performance.

### 16. Filling Missing Data in Test Set
Fill missing data in the test set to ensure consistent feature availability.

### 17. Comparing Columns Using Python Sets
Identify the differences between columns in the training and test datasets using Python sets.

### 18. Feature Importance
Analyze feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to bulldozer prices.

### 19. Using XGBoost
Implement the XGBoost algorithm for regression and assess its performance.

### 20. XGBoost Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tune hyperparameters of the XGBoost model.

### 21. Using Linear Regression
